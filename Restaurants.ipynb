    "Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. Logistic regression is a useful analysis method for classification problems, where you are trying to determine if a new sample fits best into a category. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to think about logistic regression is that it is a linear regression but for classification problems. Logistic regression essentially uses a logistic function defined below to model a binary output variable (Tolles & Meurer, 2016). The primary difference between linear regression and logistic regression is that logistic regression's range is bounded between 0 and 1. In addition, as opposed to linear regression, logistic regression does not require a linear relationship between inputs and output variables."

The lists with size greater than 1000 will be truncated to 1000. For the lists that have length less than 1000, we will add 0 at the end of the list until it reaches the max length.

Alternatively we can also train our own embeddings using Keras embedding layer. **Word embeddings can be thought of as an alternate to one-hot encoding along with dimensionality reduction.**\n",
